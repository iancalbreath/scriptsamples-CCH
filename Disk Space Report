REM Now we rename the file uniformly and append the current date.  "Swing" represents my shift, and is also appended.
cd "C:\Users\ian\Documents\ScriptFiles"
ren "DiskSpaceRemaining.xlsx" "DiskSpace_%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%_Swing.xlsx"

REM Finally, we'll open the file we have created and renamed.
start "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\EXCEL.EXE" "C:\Users\ian\Documents\ScriptFiles\DiskSpace_%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%_Swing.xlsx"
