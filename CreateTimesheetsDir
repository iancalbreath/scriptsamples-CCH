rem This .bat should be scheduled to run on the 1st of each month using Task Scheduler.  I have a simple CMD command to do that, as you cannot schedule things for the 1st of each month on Task Scheduler's GUI. 
rem schtasks /create /tn "CreateTSDir" /tr "C:/Users/ian/Documents/Timesheets/CreateTSD/CreateTSD.bat" /sc monthly /st 15:30 

rem This .bat creates a folder inside my Timesheets folder that is named with the current abbreviated month and current year.  ex. "Jan 2024"
rem It's to be partnered with my CreatePDFs.bat file which creates two .pdf files that are copies of a blank timesheet template that are named with the current month and year. One is for the first half of the month, and one is for the second.
